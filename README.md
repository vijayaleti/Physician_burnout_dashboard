## Data Schema

The dashboard expects an Excel file with a "MetricData" sheet containing:

| Column Name | Description | Type |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| `reportingperiodstartdate` | Start date of reporting period | Date |
| `reportingperiodenddate` | End date of reporting period | Date |
| `specialty` | Physician specialty | String |
| `value` | Workload metric | Numeric |

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your Excel file follows the required schema
2. **Update Data Path**: Modify the file path in the notebook to point to your dataset
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute all cells in the Jupyter notebook
4. **Launch Dashboard**: The dashboard will start automatically on `localhost:8050`
5. **Interact**: Use the dropdown to filter by specialty and explore the visualizations

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Import required libraries and dependencies
2. **Data Loading**: Read Excel file and load the "MetricData" sheet
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and normalize column names
4. **Feature Scaling**: Apply StandardScaler to workload values
5. **Clustering**: Perform K-means clustering to group physicians
6. **Dashboard Creation**: Build interactive Dash application with callbacks

## Dashboard Features

### Interactive Components:
- **Specialty Dropdown**: Filter analysis by physician specialty
- **Trend Chart**: Line plot showing workload trends over time
- **Cluster Scatter Plot**: Physicians colored by cluster assignment

### Callback Functions:
- `update_trend_chart()`: Updates trend visualization based on specialty selection
- `update_cluster_chart()`: Updates cluster visualization with filtered data

## Customization Options

- **Adjust Clustering**: Modify the number of clusters (default: 3) in the K-means algorithm
- **Change Metrics**: Replace workload values with other burnout indicators
- **Add Visualizations**: Extend with heatmaps, bar charts, or box plots
- **Modify Filters**: Add additional filtering options (date range, department, etc.)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add statistical significance testing for cluster differences
- [ ] Implement predictive modeling for burnout risk
- [ ] Create export functionality for reports and visualizations
- [ ] Add user authentication and role-based access
- [ ] Integrate with electronic health records (EHR) systems
- [ ] Develop mobile-responsive interface
- [ ] Add real-time data streaming capabilities

## Sample Output

The dashboard provides:
- **Trend Analysis**: Visual representation of workload changes over time
- **Clustering Results**: Physicians grouped into low, medium, and high workload categories
- **Specialty Insights**: Department-specific burnout patterns
- **Interactive Exploration**: Dynamic filtering and real-time updates

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare Administration**: Monitor physician workload distribution
- **Quality Improvement**: Identify departments with high burnout risk
- **Resource Planning**: Optimize staffing based on workload patterns
- **Research**: Analyze factors contributing to physician burnout
- **Policy Development**: Support evidence-based workforce policies
